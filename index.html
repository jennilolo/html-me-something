                <h2>Dallas, TX</h2>
                <p>I went to see Beyonce for the first time ever with my friend that lives there that's a superfan.
                    It was hot as hell for May (mid 90s like what?!?!?)but we had a good time.
                    Because I was just looking at flight prices, I ended up at the next two destinations.</p>

                <h2>Phoenix, AZ</h2>
                <p>Got a flight on American for the low (since it was the middle of the week)
                    and hooked up with my brother and his family(my nephews are too cute, BTW!) in the Valley of the Sun.
                    Again it was hot but it was expected!</p>

                <h2>Indio, CA</h2>
                <p>My brother: oh that's only 4 or so hours away</p>
                <p>Me: LET'S DO IT!!! We haven't seen our cousin in hellas!</p>
                <p> And that's how we ended up there a month after Coachella, it's really chill</p>

                <h2>Las Vegas</h2>
                <p>Vegas in July, can't be nothing but hot, but even they were saying it's hotter than normal.
                    I guess 112 is hot anywhere except maybe Death Valley or the Sahara</p>
